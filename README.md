# Windows-SysAdminScripts

Windows system administrators design scripts for automate repetitive tasks, simplify system management, and improve operational efficiency in Windows environments.

Many system administrators build collections like this to centralize scripts they use for day-to-day tasks—similar to other community repositories that provide ready-to-use automation tools.

This repository is intended to serve as a toolkit of scripts that help with:

  - Routine Windows administration tasks

  - Automation of repetitive or manual work

  - Quickly performing system checks and fixes

  - Improving reliability and standardization


So in order to do so I created a “switch” statement that continues to prompt a user by doing each of the following activities, until a user presses key 5:

1. I used a regular expression, list files within the Requirements1 folder, with the .log file extension and redirect the results to a new file called “DailyLog.txt” within the same directory without overwriting existing data. Each time the user selects this prompt, the current date should precede the listing. (User presses key 3.)

------------
2.  List the files inside the “Requirements1” folder in tabular format, sorted in ascending alphabetical order. Direct the output into a new file called “C916contents.txt” found in your “Requirements1” folder. (User presses key 2.)

3.  List the current CPU and memory usage. (User presses key 3.)

------------
4.  List all the different running processes inside your system. Sort the output by virtual size used least to greatest, and display it in grid format. (User presses key 4.)

5.  Exit the script execution. (User presses key 5.)
